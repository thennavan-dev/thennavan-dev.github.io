# About

Location removed · Contact removed

I'm an Information Technology graduate and full‑stack developer with a strong interest in cybersecurity and ethical hacking. I build practical, secure web and backend systems using TypeScript, Node.js, React, Docker, and Nginx — and I enjoy taking projects from prototype to production.

I have real-world experience from internships and competitions, where I've worked on backend engineering, deployment automation, and IoT solutions. I also practice on platforms like Hack The Box and other CTF environments to sharpen my security skills.

### Selected Experience

- Software Developer Intern, Fleettrack — Bangalore (Jun 2024 – Aug 2024)
  - Contributed to backend development with TypeScript and MongoDB, optimized queries, and added timestamped logging.
  - Automated log monitoring with Python and improved incident detection.
  - Containerized services using Docker and configured Nginx for reliable routing and deployments.

- Web Developer Intern, Source Coders Technology — Tiruppur (Jun 2023 – Jan 2024)
  - Built web applications using PHP, Node.js, and React for small-business clients.
  - Integrated IoT data flows into dashboards and improved deployment workflows.

### Projects

- Smart Helmet (IoT Safety Solution)
  - Raspberry Pi, LoRa, Arduino, DHT11, MQ7, NEO‑6M. Built a worker-safety monitoring system for low-connectivity environments. Winner — PALS Hackathon at IIT Madras.

- Thread Detection AI (Final Year Project)
  - Python, TensorFlow — developed models and an interactive Streamlit UI to detect anomalies from network and system logs.
